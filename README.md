Developed a machine learning model to predict disease classes using genetic microarray data. Applied classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests on a dataset of over 7,000 gene expressions. Leveraged feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Achieved 98.6% accuracy using AdaBoost, demonstrating strong data analysis and predictive modeling skills.
